    "contactoH1": "Habitación Número 34 is a non-profit art space based in Madrid. HN34 main mission is to foster emerging young art produced in Spain through monthly installations, live installation residencies, sound residencies and digital residencies within our own Metaverse. The space has a large window to the outside, which allows each installation and project to be visible from the outside.",
    "contactoP1": "HN was born from the idea of recreating the most intimate and private place of each artist, their own room, where everyone shapes their dreams. Here, these dreams do not escape into the sky, but rather fall to the ground and materialize. This is where all the monthly installations we present come from.",
    "contactoP2": "One of the main goals of HN34 is to prevail as a reference in the cultural sector in terms of artistic development. Create new integrations with emerging art and confront what has already been learned. Be in constant evolution.",
    "contactoP3": "From HN34 we propose that art should be public and free. For this reason, we offer visibility to emerging artists, who have greater difficulties in being positioned in the market. HN34 proposes a new way of relating to art, moving away from conventional industry. We want to mobilize these projects in accessible and free spaces, interact with different audiences and provoke new models of exchange through art.",
    "contactoH2": "About us",
